// Create an instance of the Express router
// The router method in this code is like setting up a map or a blueprint for handling different kinds of requests in a web application. It helps organize and define how the application should respond when someone visits different URLs. Think of it as creating a list of instructions for the app to follow when it receives specific requests, like "show me all tasks" or "register a new user." This makes the code neat and helps the app know what to do when someone interacts with it.
